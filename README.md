Hello! 

This is my first full project. This website will showcase skills I have 
learned on www.theodinproject.com. I have learned how to operate the 
terminal using Bash. I also have learned GIT, Git_Hub, and HTML. I have 
also learned how HTML, CSS, and JAVA are related into making a webpage. 

This webpage will be a simple yet easy to understand recipe webpage.
